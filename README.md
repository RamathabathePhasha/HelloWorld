Front-End Developer
<p class="description"> 
                        I'm a determined young woman who loves IT.
                         I work hard and stay focused to reach my goals. 
                         I enjoy learning and growing in the IT field.
                          I'm in my third year studying IT software development.
                           Even though I don't have work experience yet, my projects and
                            assignments show my skills. I'm confident I can handle any task.
